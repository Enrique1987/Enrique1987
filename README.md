### Hi! I am *Enrique Benito Casado*.

---

I m computer engineer currently working as a **Data Solution Architect**, since 2011 I am involved in data related projects, occupying different positions, mainly as Data Engineer and ML Engineer.

Three of my favorite things are: `Data`, `Python` and `Machine Learning`.
Technologies in which I specialise :

- Data Engineer Stuff
- Python
- Machine Learning
- GenAI
- T-SQL/NoSQL/ETL

 In my github I'm taking notes of what I'm learning in my professional life as well as what I learn in courses and videos, these are my notes but if someone else can use them I'm glad.


#### current philosophy:
 - Be a good person.
 - To know something about everything, and to know everything about something. 
 - Talk is cheap, show me the code.
 - 80/20.
 - Think big, start small.
 - Automate the Boring Stuff(probably with Python and chatgpt).
 - Stoicism.
 - Feminism.
